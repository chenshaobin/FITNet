## Data Preparation
**Divide the data into k-folds for cross-validation**.  
If k-fold cross-validation is used during training, you can use `create_excelFile_for_k_fold_dataset.py` to split the data into k-folds.  
Before using this script, make sure that your image data is stored in different folders by category, as shown below:  
![dataFolder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenshaobin/FITNet/master/images/dataFolder.jpg)  
```python

excelFileSavePath = r'xxx\xxx.xlsx'  
imgRootPath = r'xxx\imgPath'  
kFold = 10  
mainObj = get_k_fold_Data(excelFileSavePath=excelFileSavePath, imgRootPath=imgRootPath, kFold=kFold, num_class=4)  
mainObj.getKFoldData()  
```  

After that, the name of the picture and the corresponding label will be stored in the excel fileï¼š
